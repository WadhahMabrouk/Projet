# OCR Results Notes:

*149 Pages of Texts total (Count excludes pages with just maps on them, no text)*
<br> 
<br> 
**Lists of Protected Monuments in Italy 2 Campania combined** (*4 pages*)                
**Rescan needed**: Yes
<br> 
**Comment**: The 1st page was readable, and errors made by the OCR were corrected. The 2nd to 4th pages have letters that are unclear to the human eye and the OCR struggles to read most of the words, I think a rescan may be necessary.

<br> 
<br> 

**Campania and Lazio short lists combined** (*10 pages*)
<br>
**Rescan needed**: No
<br> 
**Comment**: 4/10 pages completely done. OCR can mostly read it but makes many errors. It took 70 minutes to correct 4 pages (read word by word, google Latin names if the text isn’t fully readable, etc.). 

<br> 
<br> 

**Campania long list combined** (*27 pages*)
<br> 
**Rescan needed:** No
<br> 
**Comment:** For the most part readable to the OCR, will have to be corrected.

<br> 
<br> 

**Civil Affairs Handbook Italy Atlas** (Fold3_Page_61,62,86,87,94,97,98) (*7 pages*)
<br> 
**Rescan needed:** No
<br> 
**Comment:** Doesn’t work very well with the split pages. Each image will have to be separated into different pages to properly format and then corrected.

<br> 
<br> 

**Lazio long list combined** (*53 pages*)
<br> 
**Rescan needed:** Yes
<br> 
**Comment:** Several white blotches throughout the document, difficult for the human eye and especially for OCR to differentiate letters at times.

<br> 
<br> 

**Zone Handbook lists Campania combined** (*4 pages*)
<br>
**Rescan needed:** Yes
<br> 
**Comment:** The OCR struggles a bit due to the low-quality scan. However, as it’s just 4 pages it could be corrected by hand, it is visible to the human eye.

<br> 
<br> 

**Works of Art in Italy Losses and Damage part 1, 2**
<br> 
**Rescan needed:** No
<br> 
**Comment:** The scans are of good quality and the OCR can make out most of the words. We will need to split the pdf so it isn’t cut in half as this confuses the OCR. We may also combine these two parts if the two parts are separated arbitrarily.

- Napoli4
(5 pages)
<br> 

**Rescan needed:** Yes
<br> 
**Comment:** All of the above images are not legible to the OCR. The OCR’s output is not usable. They are each short so again, they could be entered by hand if getting new scans is not possible.

**Ways to fix OCR errors:**
1. Manually: Review each page of OCR output and manually correct any errors. This method would be time-consuming, but it is the most accurate way to correct errors.
 
2. OCR correction software: There are several software programs available that can automatically correct OCR errors. These programs work by comparing the OCR output to a dictionary or reference database, and then suggest corrections or replacements for any errors.
3. ChatGPT: This is the option we’ve opted for. We’ve written a script that takes an input file and uses the ChatGPT API to correct the errors. The input is split into 4000 token parts and sent to the API one at a time. The script then puts the output into one file. The results were very promising.
 
4. Rescan: Some of the scans are too low quality to be usable. We will need to have these documents rescanned.
