CAMPANIA
This region took the first shock of pitched battles or the Italan mainland when
the Fifth Array poured on to the beaches from Salerno to Faestum ot
September 9th, I943. The issue bung in the balance for some days at Salerno
and in the mountain passes leading inland. Destruction was concentrated in the
centre of the landing-area, devastating Battipaglia and even Eboli, but on the
flanks both Paestum, with its splendid Greek Temples, and the northern part of
Salerno, with its venerable Cathedral, escaped without setious damage.
The
picturesque towns aong the Amalt coast were fortunately just outside the
battle ground and escaped all harm.
After intense and bitter fighting, the break-through came.
Fortunately the
battle swept on around the north side of Vesuvius, by-passing both Herculaneum
and Pompen.
On September goth, thee weeks after the initial assault on the
beaches, lightly damaged Avellino fell, and the next day the Allies entered Naples.
The city had suffered heavy and repeated bombardment from the ait. Street
fighting surged through the town for three days, and before retreating the enemy
planted delayed-action bombs.
The outstanding disaster in the town was the
destruction by fire of the great church of Santa Chiara, and the wanton destruction
by the Germans of the incalculably valuable historical documents of the State
Archives.
From blasted and liberated Naples the battle surged on northwards. Benevento,
its Cathedral and the entire lower city between the Cathedral and the Ponte
Vanvitelli, a mass of wins, fell on October and; Aversa was outs on October sth,
and two days later Capua fell. By October IIth the line ran from Castel Volturno
and the sea on the left to Pontelandolfo in the mountains on the right; and on the
night of October 12th-x3th the strongly contested crossing of the Volturno was
made successtully.

Mignano and Sessa Aurunca. On the banks of the Garigliano and the Rapido,
at the very boundaty of Campania and Lazio, the forward movement stopped,
and the armies settled down to the long winter before the defences of Cassino.
ANTIQUITIES AND ARCHEOLOGICAL COLLECIIONS
Although the Antiquities of Campanta suffered more than those of any other
region, we ate fortunate in their not having sustained heavier losses.
Immediately on the right flank of the bitterly contested Salerno landings lay
Paestum, and well within the Allied beach-head, the recently excavated Greek
Temples at the mouth of the Sele with their magnificent archaic metopes. Neither
of these suffered any significant damage. Herculaneum sustained only blast
damage. Of all the classical sites in the Campi Flegrei, only the tunnel cut by
Agrippa from Lake Avernus to Cuma was damaged. This was used as an Italian
ammunition dump, and was blown-up and almost totally destroyed by the re
treating Germans.
Otherwise Cura, Pozzuoli and Baia are intact, as is the amphi-
theatre at Santa Maria Capua Vetere.
The Roman bridge at Capua was totally
destroyed and that at Benevento was damaged, as were several lesser bridges
on the Via Appia near Benevento.
78
At Pompell, damage from the Is6 bombs which tell within the excavated
area was widespread. The bombs were, however, of a light calibre and the
total of significant destruction is limited. The effect on the general appearance
of the ruins, after clearance and consolidation, is almost negligible.
An interesting by-product of the war was the discovery, while bulldozing for
gravel on an aerodrome near Paestum, of a prehistoric (probably neolithic)
cemetery, consisting of small oval chambers with vertical shafts and containing
inhurnation-burials.
Another discovery was the considerable remains of first-
century masonry within the core of the destroyed Ponte Serratella on the Via
Appla near Benevento.
A number of museums and archeological collections were damaged or
suffered loss. The National Museum at Naples is untouched, but the Antiquarium
at Pompeii and the Museo Campano at Capua suffered direct hits.
Details of datage are as follows:
BENEVENTO
The ArcH OF TRAJAN sustained negligible splinter-damage.
The Roman BriDgE was bombed and partially blown-up, but cat be
repaited.
The DOMIlIANIC OBELISK was heavily pitted.
CANCELLO (Napol)
VILLA SPINELLI. This was a private collection, derived mainly from the
necropolis of Suessola and was delberately rifed by German officers. Coins
and important gold jewellery were stolen.
CAPUA (Caser la
THE ROMAn BrIDgE was totally destroyed without notable damage to the
important mediaeval outworks built by Frederic II and recently restored.
MUSEO PROVINCIALE CamPaÑo. About one-third of the building was
destroyed by direct bomb-hits, but the majority of fragile exhibits, notably
the series of Campanian terracotta, was successfully salvaged. The series
ot stone mother-deities is mattly intact.
NAPLES
MUSEO NAZIONATE. The building was undamaged and all movable objects
were evacuated. However, five of the large classical bronzes and the entire
collection of classical jewellery, deposited in the Abbey of Montecassino,
formed part of the loot stolen from the Abbey by the Hermann Göring
Division, but later recovered in Austria.
PAESTUM (Salerno)
GREEK TEMPLES. These sustained no damage, but the deposit of terra-
cottas was stolen from the tower.
SESSA AURUNCA (Napoli)
MUSEO ARCHEOLOGICO.
Some damage was done to the building, and parts
of the collections disappeated during occupancy by French troops.
TEANO (Napoli
The AMpHITHEaTRe was badly damaged.

TORRE PANDOLEO (Napoli)
TORRE DI PANDOLEO CapODIFIERO. This was blowa up by the Gertoans.
The collections, mostly trom Minturno, and the records were utterly destroyed.
MOVABLE WORKS OF ART, GALLERIES AND DEPOSITS.
In all Campania not a single movable work of art was destroyed through being
left in place. There were, of course, the inevitable minor losses when museums
or churches sustained damage, but on the whole the deposit programme was
remarkably successful.
Of the instances of damage or loss to movable works of art that had been
moved to what was confidently believed to be satety, the outstanding cases ate
those of the Montecassino deposit, the Museo Filangieri Collection and the ill-
fated Mostra d'Oltremare.
The MONTECASSINO DePOSIT. On the oth-Ioth September, 1943, one hundred
and eighty-seven cases of works of att from Naples were moved to the Abbey of
Montecassino. These included twenty-seven cases of large bronzes, sixty cases
of small bronzes and minor objects, and titty-one cases of paintings trom the
Museo Nazionale; biteen cases ot pantings from the lluseo sat Martino; three
cases from the Reggia di Capodimonte; and thirty-one cases from the Mostra
d'Oltremare.
During October, 1943, ostensibly " to protect the treasures from, the Anglo-
American barbarians" the infamous Hermann Göring Division removed the entire
deposit from Montecassino to their Divisional Headquarters at Spoleto. Not until
January, 1944, after three months of Italian protests and negotiations, did the
Division finally bring the cases back to Rome, where amid much sanctimonious
fanfare and publicity they were handed over to the Italians for refuge in the
Vatican.
However, after the fall of Rome, when it was possible to check the
cases in the Vatican with the inventories brought from Naples, it was found that
the Germans had handed over only 172 cases; thus stealing futeen, and extracting
chosen items from several others.
Among the more important missing objects were paintings by Breughel, Titian,
Filippino Lippi, Joos van Cleve, Raphael, Claude Lotraine, Palma il. Vecchio
and Sebastiano del Piombo; a suit of Charles V's armour; two bronze deer from
Herculaneum; an Apollo, a seated Mercury and a female Dancet, also from
Herculaneum; the entire collection of gold jewellery ftom the Museo Nazionale;
and a great many Ligozzi water-colouts.
It now appears that all these objects were taken to Berlin in December, I943,
for a presentation to Göring as a birthday present, and they were later deposited
in the salt-mine at Alt Aussee, where they were located in May, 1945, by American
troops, who transterred them to their Collecting Centre at Munich to be checked
The MUsko FrANGIERI COLlECTION. The most valuable objects were moved
to the Villa Montesano at San Paolo Belsito, near Nola, together with 900 cases
of historical documents from the Neapolitan State Archives. On September 3oth,
I943, the Germans discovered this deposit and methodically and completely

The Mostra opened on May oth, Ig4o, and closed in considerable disorder a
month later.
The Fine Arts sections were eventually placed in official deposits,
but the other items were stored on the exhibition grounds.
Frevious to the Allied occupation of Naples, there had been no organised
supervision of the grounds, which were more of less open to all comers, and
when they were occupied in October, 1943 by the Fifth Army for medical
purposes, the buildings were found already well stripped of doors and windows.
The fate of many of the exhibits, including much of the ethnographic materian,
will probably never be known. Flowever, after months of checking most of the
antiquities and works of art have been accounted for.

LIBRARIES
In Campania, to a degree not surpassed elsewhere, German vandalist in its
blind, campaign of terrorism against the written word must answer to world
opinion. By fire, methodically and carefully applied, they destroyed not only the
valuable historical documents of the State Archives, but also a considerable
portion of the University of Naples and two of the city's most important
*lIbtarles; the Brancacciana Library and that of the Royal Society.
Detaiis ot damage are as follows :-
BENEVENTO
BIBLIOTECA CAPITOLARE. This was housed in the Cathedtal, which was
practically destroyed. Most of the manuscripts and books were moved to
the Biblioteca Arcivescovile.

was sustained by the contents.
CAPUA (Napoli)

Of all the Regions of Italy, Lazio is one of the worst shattered by. the
wat. For six long months it harboured massive contending forces and its
southern Provinces were the scene of one of the most devastating attacks in
military history. Damage to monuments south of Rome is geary, but it 15
remarkable that there is anything left of the towns, lying on the axes of the Liti
Valley and the coastal drives which occurred during way, 1944.
At the beginning of the great assault Cassino had already been reduced to
rubble. Early victims were Ausonia, Formia, Gaeta, Itti and Fondi on the
Fifth Army flank; on the right the small villages of the Liri Valley were virtually
ploughed under by the Eighth Army's drive, whete Pontecorvo and Aquino;
imbedded in the German fixed defence line, suffered terxibly. The retreat of the
Germans, and their pursuit by harassing aircraft, brought heavy damage to all
towns astride the highways, particularly to Alatri and Ferentino.
Fortunately,
the picturesque town of Anagni escaped lightly.
Of the great Christian sanctuaries and monastic centres, Montecassino, the
greatest, is a heap of shattered rubble. Subiaco escaped with damage only to a
recently-added wing and Fart was untouched.
Grottaferrata sustained
considerable superficial damage to roofs and windows, but its incomparable
library had been evacuated to the Vatican. The three great Cistercian houses
of Fossanova, Valvisciolo and Casamari are intact.
The Castelli Roman inevitably paid the penalty of their position it the reat
of the German positions against the Anzio beach-head. Frascati suffered heavily,
and Albano, Ariccia and Genzano all suffered in varying degrees. Welletri was
heavily damaged and Valmontone was virtually destroyed. The heart of medieval
Palestrima was obliterated, and Tivoli took heavy punishment.
In Rome itselt, the damage was light except for the untortunate bits on san
Lorenzo in the bombing of the adjacent rallway and marshaling yards.
Notth of Rome heavy damage was concentrated, at Civitavecchia, and at Viterbo
where the circuit of the walls to the mouth and south was smashed both within
and without, flattening large areas within the Porta Romana and south of San
Francesco; and partially demolishing the three fine mediaeval churches of Santa
Maria della Varità, San Sisto and San Francesco. Elsewhere to the north of
Rome damage is widespread along the roads, but is nowhere intense.
ANTIQUITIES AND ARCHEOLOGICAL COLLECTIONS
With the exception of the deliberate destruction of the galleys at Nem and the
wanton destruction of one of the tombs at Tarquinia, the antiquities of Lazio
escared lightly. Taking into consideration the great number of remains and the
intonsity of the fighting there was inevitably a certain amount ot scattered damage;
but no other major monument suftered harm. Some ot the archeological
collections sustained loss or partial destruction, but the best material had, in almost
all cases, been removed to safety. Only at Viterbo was the damage of serious
dimensions.
The destruction of half of the solemn provincial Etruscan
sarcophagi that formerly lined the nave of Santa Maria della Verità is a sad loss.
