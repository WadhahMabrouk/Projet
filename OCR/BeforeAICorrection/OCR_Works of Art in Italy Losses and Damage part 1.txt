Works of Art in Italy
all costs. Of the fifteen buildings listed as being of the first importance,
the following escaped damage: S. AGOsTINO, PALAZZO BENINCASA, PALAZZO
FERRETTI, ARCH OF TRAJAN.
S. MARIA DELLA PIAZZA, the most important monument in the city, with
its elaborate early thirteenth-century façade adorned with sculptures by
MASTER PenIrePUS (which had been carefully protected), suffered only slight
blast damage to the roof.
The CatheDraL (S. CIRIACO) lost its roof, and the end wall of the Chapel
of the Crocifisso in the south transept collapsed and fell through the floor
into the crypt. Fortunately the two inner arcades are for the most part intact.
Restoration can be undertaken with little loss of character.
S. DOMFNICo. The false vaulting of the nave has collapsed, but the
iriternal decoration below cornice level has suffered relatively little.
S. FRANCESCO DELLE SCATE.
The Campanile was destroyed, leaving a gap
in the south wall of the church, but for the rest there was only minor blast
damage, and the façade, with the Gothic portal by GIORGIO DA SEBENICO,
was unharraed.
The east wing of the cloisters was destroyed, together with
the whole of the west range of the convent attached.
• S. MaRIA DELLA MISERICORDIA was destroyed beyond possibility of
restoration.
PArAZZO COMUNAIE. The interior was badly smashed, but the façade
is preserved.
PALAZZO DEGLI ANZIANI (PREFEITURA). The west wing was destroyed,
but the rest of the building was undamaged.
• PALAZZO DEL SENATO. Part of the important façade is in danger of collapse.
The LOggIA DEr MeRcaNTI is a wreck internally, but the lower part of
GIORGIO Da SeBeNICO's façade still stands, saved by protective masonry.
VANVIIBILI'S " Lazaretto " has suffered a good deal of superfcial damage,
but is perhaps not seriously ruined.
The MUseum and PICTURE GatteRr sustained several direct hits, but
most of the pictures had been removed. Of the archeological collections,
one-half was stored in the cellars and the rest left in sit.
The CoMMUNaL LIBraRY is buried under a mass of fallen masonty.
These are only. the most important of Ancona's monuments. A number
of lesser works have perished or been seriously damaged. The Roman
AMPHITHEATRE, ARCO CLEMENTINO, PORIA PIA and the FONTANA DEL
CarAMO have escaped injury; as also the church of S. MaRIa IN PORTo
Nuovo, six miles from the city.
ANGHIARI (Arezzo)
Here the damage was fortunately slight.
S. AgostINo suffered some shell-holes in the roof and walls, but has been
repaired. The splendid sixteenth-century terra-cotta relief and the triptych
by MATTEO DI GIOVANNI were unharmed.
La COLlEgIaTA is undamaged, and SoGIIANt's " Last Supper " and DELIa
ROBBIA's " Madonna della Misericordia " are unhurt.
The BADIA is undamaged.
The PALAzzO COMUNALE suffered slight roof damage, but the archives are safe.
Losses and Survivals
ANTELLA (Firenze)
The PARISH CHURCH OF S. MarIa, with its fine Romanesque triumphal
arch, and the Oratory OF S. CaTerINa, with the series of frescoes by
SPINELLO ARETINO, illustrating the life of the saint, are, both untouched.
APRUTINO (Pescara)
Is undamaged.
AOUILA
Is undamaged.
AQUINO (Frosinone)
S. MARIA DELLA LIBeRA suffered heavily. The whole of the nave roof
and the roof of one aisle are gone. The upper part of the south wall is
damaged by shell-fire, and the south wall of the transept is cracked.
The
outside of the aisle is badly chipped and pitted.
Provisional repairs have
been executed.
The Byzantine mosaic over the doot lost a patch about a
foot square.
ToMMaso was ruined beyond repair.
MaRK ANTONY'S ARcH suffered slight damage to the top stones; other-
wise the TEMPLe rUIns and AMPHITHEATRE are undamaged.
ARCE (Napoli)
The MEGALITHIC WALLs were badly breached by bombing and shell-fire.
ARCENO (Siena)
The VIlLa GAMBIa CasTeLLI was used as a deposit for pictures from
SIENA, GROSSErO, and MASSA MARITIMA. This deposit had a series of
narrow escapes. The Germans proposed to carry off a large number of the
pictures, but were resisted by the guardian, Superintendent Professor Enzo
Carli of Siena, and, because they were leaving in a hurry, were resisted
successfully.
