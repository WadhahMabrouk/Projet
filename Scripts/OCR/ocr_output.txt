SMOKED SALMON PASTA
SPINACH, SPRING ONION, LEMON, CURDS & PARMESAN
SERVES 1 | TOTAL 8 MINUTES
125g fresh lasagne sheets
2 spring onions
80g spinach
60g smoked salmon (2 slices)
½ a lemon
5g Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon cottage cheese
Boil the kettle. Cut the lasagne sheets in half lengthways, then into 2cm strips,
using a crinkle-cut knife, if you’ve got one. Trim the spring onions and finely
chop with the spinach and half the salmon. Finely grate the lemon zest, then the
Parmesan, keeping them separate. Put a 28cm frying pan on a high heat.
Once hot, put a little drizzle of olive oil into the pan with the spring onions,
spinach, chopped salmon and lemon zest. Scatter the pasta into the pan, then
carefully pour in enough boiling kettle water to just cover the pasta – about
250ml. Let it bubble away for 4 minutes, or until the pasta has absorbed most of
the water and you’ve got a nice sauce, stirring regularly and loosening with an
extra splash of water, if needed. Turn the heat off, squeeze in the lemon juice, stir
in the cottage cheese and Parmesan, then season to perfection. Delicately tear
over the remaining salmon, and finish with a kiss of extra virgin olive oil, if you
like.
