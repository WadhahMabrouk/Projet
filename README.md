# CulturalHeritage project

This project consists of two experiments. An experiment on the destruction of the Second World War, based on documents from UNESCO. A second experiment based on pigments and colors, based on current and historical texts.
The first experiment proposes a read-me. The second read-me remains to be done.

## Description WWII project
The project is a collaboration with the School of Culture and Communication at Swansea University Wales UK, and the LIG Steamer team. The case study focuses on the destruction carried out during the 2nd World War in Italy.
This project falls within the context of the recommendations of UNESCO and government structures culture.gouv.fr which have implemented actions to safeguard the cultural and natural heritage in the face of threats of degradation, destruction, spoliation and disappearance of heritage during conflicts. Actions advocated in particular by UNESCO are materialised by the creation and maintenance of world heritage lists. These heritage lists are provided to the armed forces and government authorities. They constitute inventories incorporating information such as maps and descriptions with quotations according to the importance of the cultural property.
The project with Nigel Pollard's team therefore focuses on the protection of heritage and cultural property in conflict zones. The proposed case study deals with the protection of cultural property and damage suffered during the Second World War and will examine the damage caused by bombs in Italian archaeological sites.
The goal of the project will be the implementation of an application using a computer architecture to allow the visualisation of data, the annotation and the identification of the main destructions of the heritage on the given sites.
